# Street Map Plugin for Unreal Engine 5 and improved useful via code
### Originally [StreetMap](https://github.com/ue4plugins/StreetMap) made by [MikeFricker](https://github.com/MikeFricker)
Mike Fricker's StreetMap Plugin originally made this plugin. And improved the code to address the inconvenient points I experienced when using it.


---
### What is the difference with the Original StreetMap Plugin?
We support the blueprint system more than the original, and with more convenient features!


#### Added Features:
Extract Roads, Buildings, Nodes into DataTable in StreetMapActor

Get Roads, Buildings, Nodes from StreetMap without StreetMapActor or Component in Blueprint
